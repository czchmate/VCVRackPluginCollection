# VCVRackPluginCollection

This is a collection of module repositories from around Github for the VCVRack virtual Eurorack platform.

Not all of the linked modules will work or compile correctly. Whenever possible, this repository links to modules for Rack v0.6. However, some of the linked repositories are optimized for Rack v0.5 and may not compile.
